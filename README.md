# RC6
This is the implementation of the RC6 algorithm in python

In cryptography, RC6 (Rivest cipher 6) is a symmetric key block cipher derived from RC5. It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin to meet the requirements of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition.

RC6 uses a variable block size, key size, and number of rounds, making it highly adaptable and flexible.
